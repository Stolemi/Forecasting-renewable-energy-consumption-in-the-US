# Forecasting-renewable-energy-consumption-in-the-US
Graduate project for the course "Machine Learning for Economists" (Teacher: Matteo Barigozzi). Master of Science in Economics, University of Bologna. The goal of the course is to present different supervised and unsupervised statistical learning methods and applications, such as: Lasso, Splines, Tree based methods, Neural Networks, PCA, Dynamic Factor Models. 

Academic project developed in a team of 4 during the fall semester 2021 and presented in January 2022. Grade: 30/30.
The project forecasts the dynamics of renewable energy consumption in the US market using monthly data on energy and fossil fuels from the US Energy Information Administration, macroeconomic variables from the FRED database and monthly prices of crude oil and natural gas provided by the World Bank. We performed three variable selection methods in order to reduce the dimen- sionality of the data: hard tresholding, partial least squares and LASSO. Then, we focused on predictions using a recurrent neural network and a factor model. To estimate the factors we relied on two different approaches: PCA and EM algorithm.
